# Verb Helper

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

This is about naming things. Especially what VERB to use.

## Introduction

I want to help people find the right verbs to name their functions/methods, because it can be confusing sometimes: Should I use `show` or `display`, `delete` or `remove`? Inconsistent word choices can make the code more difficult to maintain and develop.

I make a simple Python script using PowerShell's approved verbs. This script is nothing but a "lookup" tool, but I find it's enough useful in my case.

## Prequisities

Python 3. (I use Python 3.10. Any versions under 3.10 are untested.)

## Usage

```{bash}
python verbh.py -v <VERB>
```

Replace `<VERB>` with a verb you want.
